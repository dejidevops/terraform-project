        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Deji and I have recently embarked on an exciting journey into the world of cloud computing. As a technology enthusiast, I was always curious about how cloud services work and how they can revolutionize the way we build and deploy applications.</p>

        <h2>Setting Up my Apache Web Server in AWS</h2>
        <p>One of my first steps was to dive into the AWS cloud. I decided to set up a web server using Apache, a popular and reliable web server software. With the help of AWS EC2, I quickly launched an instance, installed Apache, and had a basic website up and running in no time.</p>

        <h2>Securing my Blog</h2>
        <p>Security was a top priority for me. I leveraged AWS security groups to restrict access to my web server only from specific IP addresses. Additionally, I configured SSL/TLS using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) to encrypt the data transmitted between my website and visitors. This way, my blog remains safe and protected from potential threats.</p>

        <h2>Using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Route 53</h2>
        <p>As my blog started gaining traction, I needed to ensure it could handle increased traffic. I incorporated an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. This way, my blog can scale effortlessly to meet demand.</p>
        <p>To provide a user-friendly domain name, I used AWS Route 53 to manage my DNS and created a custom domain name for my blog. Now, visitors can access my blog using the easy-to-remember domain.</p>

        <h2>Continuing the Journey</h2>
        <p>I'm thrilled about my progress in cloud computing so far, but I know this is just the beginning. There is so much more to explore and learn in the cloud ecosystem, including serverless computing, containerization, managed services, and more. I can't wait to dive deeper into these technologies and keep sharing my experiences with you all.</p>

        <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey!</p>
